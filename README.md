# C-Programming-Course
- All solved lab tasks from my C programming course
- All tasks are either my ideas or given by a professor
- LV 5 is in it's folder because it has multiple code files so it is easier for CMake to compile it
- Every program that reads/writes binary/txt file, writes/reads it from "TextAndBinaryFiles" folder
